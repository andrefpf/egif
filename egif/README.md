I've learned something about Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and MY GOD, thats so faster and easyer to implement and understand than DCT. So thats my transformation now. I will not delete this folder in a while because maybe there is something here thats still usefull, and I may still use.

The stuff that I'm implementing is on sketch folder (python) or src (C)
